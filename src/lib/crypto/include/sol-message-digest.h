/**
 * @defgroup Message_Digest Message Digest (Hash)
 * @ingroup Crypto
 *
 * Message Digest algorithms will take a byte stream and
 * compute a hash that may be used to later validate the
 * identity. Even the smallest variation of the input data
 * will have an avalanche effect that drastically change the
 * output data.
 *
 * Wikipedia says (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function):
 * The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
 *  - it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message
 *  - it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash
 *  - it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash
 *  - it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.
 *
 * Common Message Digest algorithms are CRC32, MD5, SHA1,
 * SHA256 and SHA512. Most of these are already broken, such
 * as CRC32 and nowadays MD5 and even SHA1, then before
 * picking one for your application, check the one that is
 * more secure and hard to break, such as SHA512.
 *
 * Soletta provides a portable API for message digests, but it doesn't
 * implement any of them. The actual work is done by the engine underneath,
 * which will depend on the build configuration. On Linux, either the kernel's
 * crypo API or OpenSSL's crypto library are available to choose at build time.
 * On RIOT-OS, only the algorithms provided by the OS are implemented. Other
 * systems lack support currently.
 *
 * When choosing an algorithm, Soletta will pass it down to the engine selected
 * for use, and to keep applications portable, it was chosen to always follow
 * the names used by the Linux kernel. If they don't match on other implementations,
 * Soletta will translate accordingly, keeping those difference transparent
 * for developers.
