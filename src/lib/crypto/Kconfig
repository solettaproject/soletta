            Message Digest algorithms will take a byte stream and
            compute a hash that may be used to later validate the
            identity. Even the smallest variation of the input data
            will have an avalanche effect that drastically change the
            output data.

            Wikipedia says (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function):
            The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
             - it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message
             - it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash
             - it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash
             - it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.

            Common Message Digest algorithms are CRC32, MD5, SHA1,
            SHA256 and SHA512. Most of these are already broken, such
            as CRC32 and nowadays MD5 and even SHA1, then before
            picking one for your application, check the one that is
            more secure and hard to break, such as SHA512.

	help
            This implementation will use the Kernel-Userspace interface
            provided by Linux. Linux implementation are often very optimized
            and in some case are hardware-accelerated.

config CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST_OPENSSL

            This implementation will use OpenSSL.

	depends on RIOT && FEATURE_CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST
	select CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST
	select CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST_COMMON
	help
            This implementation will use the algorithms natively supported by
            RIOT-OS.

config CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST_NONE
	bool "None"
	depends on FEATURE_CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST
	select CRYPTO_MESSAGE_DIGEST
	help
            No implementation is to be used, all functions will return error.
