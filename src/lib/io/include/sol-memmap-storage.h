/**
 * @defgroup Memmap Memmap
 * @ingroup IO
 *
 * @brief Memory mapped persistence storage (like NVRAM or EEPROM) API on Soletta.
 *
 * A map must be provided, either directly via @c sol_memmap_add_map or by
 * informing a JSON file to Soletta runner or generator.
 * This map needs to contain a property @c _version (@c SOL_MEMMAP_VERSION_ENTRY),
 * which will store version of map stored. This API will refuse to work if
 * stored map is different from map version. Note that @c _version field
 * is a @c uint8_t and that versions should start on 1, so Soletta will know
 * if dealing with a totally new storage. It also considers 255 (0xff) as a
 * non-value, so fit new EEPROMs.
 * Note that a map may define a timeout value to perform writes. This way,
 * writings can be grouped together, as all writing operations will be
 * performed at timeout end. That said, it's important to note that when
 * writing is performed, no order is guaranteed for different keys, i.e.,
 * writing to 'a' and 'b' can be performed, at timeout end, as 'b' and 'a'
 * - but for a given key, only the last write will be performed at timeout end.
 * Multiple writes for the same key before timeout end will result in previous
 * writes being replaced, and their callbacks will be informed with status
 * -ECANCELED.
