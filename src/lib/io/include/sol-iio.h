 * @brief Address an IIO device from a list of commands to find them.
 *
 * IIO devices may exist on sysfs after being plugged, or need to be
 * explicitly created if, for instance, they use I2C or SPI interfaces.
 * This function provides a way of addressing an IIO device to get its IIO
 * id from a series of space separated @a commands. Commands are processed
 * from left to right and processing stops on first command that worked.
 * A provided callback will be called with IIO device id or -1 if no command
 * resolved to an IIO device.
 *
 * There are essentially five commands. It can be an absolute path
 * (starting with '/') pointing to sysfs dir of device. Alternatively,
 * it can be @c i2c/X-YYYY, for i2c device, where @a X is the bus number and
 * @a YYYY is the device number, eg, @c 7-0069 for device 0x69 on bus 7.
 * If its a raw number, will be interpreted as IIO device id and this function
 * will only check the id. It can also be device name, as it appears on
 * 'name' file on sysfs.
 * Finally, it can describe a command to @a create an IIO device. In this case,
 * command is a combination on the form
 * <tt> create,\<bus_type\>,\<rel_path\>,\<devnumber\>,\<devname\> </tt>
 *
 * @arg @a bus_type is the bus type, supported values are: i2c
 * @arg @a rel_path is the relative path for device on '/sys/devices',
 * like 'platform/80860F41:05'
 * @arg @a devnumber is device number on bus, like 0xA4
 * @arg @a devname is device name, the one recognized by its driver
 *
 * If device already exists, will just return its IIO id on @a cb.
 *
 * @param commands space separated commands on format specified above. e.g. <tt>
 * l3g4200d create,i2c,platform/80860F41:05,0x69,l3g4200d </tt>
 * @param cb callback to be called after device resolution. It contains IIO
 * device id, or -1 if unsuccessful
 * @param data user data to be passed to callback
 *
 * @return @a true if attempt to resolve device was successful, @a false
 * othewise. Note that to really know if device was resolved, besides return,
 * one needs to check callback device_id.
