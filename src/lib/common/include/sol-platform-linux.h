/**
 * @brief Fork a new process and run the given @a on_fork callback on that process.
 *
 * This call will execute fork(), then wait for children to be ready
 * (internally uses a pipe() to synchronize), reset all signal
 * handlers to their default values and then call @a on_fork. This
 * user-provided function may then do whatever it wants and when it
 * returns the process will exit with @c EXIT_SUCCESS. The other way
 * to exit is to call sol_platform_linux_fork_run_exit().
 *
 * @note whenever the user wants to exit with a different code or
 *       prematurely, never call exit() directly, instead call
 *       sol_platform_linux_fork_run_exit() (or _exit()). The reason
 *       is that functions registered with atexit() or on_exit()
 *       shouldn't be executed in the children processes.
 *
 * When the child exits, the user-provided @a on_child_exit is called
 * and after this point the handle returned by
 * sol_platform_linux_fork_run() is invalidated (freed), thus
 * shouldn't be used any further.
 *
 * The main process may force the child process to stop using
 * sol_platform_linux_fork_run_stop(), that blocking call will send @c
 * SIGTERM and wait the child to exit using waitpid(), calling @a
 * on_child_exit before it returns.
 *
 * @param on_fork the function to call back after the child process is
 *        ready. The given data is the same pointer given as @a data.
 * @param on_child_exit the function to call back on the main
 *        (original) process when the child exits. The given data is
 *        the same pointer given as @a data, @c pid is the process
 *        identifier (as returned by
 *        sol_platform_linux_fork_run_get_pid()) and the status is the
 *        one returned by libc waitpid(), that means the macros such
 *        as WIFEXITED(), WEXITSTATUS(), WIFSIGNALED(), WTERMSIG() and
 *        similar from @c sys/wait.h should be used to interpret it.
 * @param data the context data to give to the callbacks @a on_fork
 *        and @a on_child_exit. It is not modified in any way by
 *        sol_platform_linux_fork_run functions.
 *
 * @return the handle to the child process or @c NULL on errors (and
 *         @c errno is set to the actual reason). The handle may be
 *         used to query the process identifier, to stop the process.
