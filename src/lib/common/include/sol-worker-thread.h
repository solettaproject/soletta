/**
 * Create and run a worker thread.
 *
 * Worker threads are meant to do processing that is hard to split and
 * play nice with cooperative workloads used by the main loop
 * (sol_idle_add(), sol_timeout_add() and sol_fd_add()). Usually this is
 * due blocking operating system calls or third party libraries that
 * don't allow work to be segmented.
 *
 * Worker threads shouldn't impact the main thread while they execute,
 * but this comes at the trade off of code complexity and
 * synchronization issues. If both the worker thread and the main
 * thread may operate on the same data simultaneously, then it may
 * result in partial reads and writes leading to inconsistent results
 * if locks are not properly done. The best approach is to have the
 * worker thread to operate on its own exclusive data and after it's
 * finished deliver that data to users from within @a finished
 * callback. If this pattern cannot be used, then employ locks to
 * segments of data that may result into race conditions.
 *
 * @note this function must be called from the @b main thread.

 *        data to be used.
