/**
 * @file
 * @brief Routines to update a Soletta app. Provide way to check, fetch and
 * install updates
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Update Update
 *
 * Updating a Soletta based app may vary depending on Soletta environment and
 * configuration. For instance, updating a static Linux Micro (PID 1) Soletta
 * based app is only a matter of replacing app file, but when using shared libs,
 * may involve update/install newer versions of used libs. So, Soletta provides
 * different update modules to update Soletta based apps on different scenarios.
 * Soletta will try to use the first module it can use, but if having different
 * modules to be loaded, environment variable SOL_UPDATE_MODULE can be used to
 * define a specific one, like SOL_UPDATE_MODULE=linux-micro-efi-update.
 *
 * When Soletta update module cheks for update, it should get version
 * and size of new file to fill @c sol_update_info.
 *
 * Each update module is free to decide how to check, fetch and install the
 * update. Check update module documentation to understand how it works.
 * Note also that comparing obtained version with app current version and
 * deciding to fetch update file is up to user/developer.
