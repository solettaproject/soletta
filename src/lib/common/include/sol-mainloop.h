 * @date 2015
 *
 * Soletta project is a framework for making IoT devices. With Soletta
 * project's libraries developers can easily write software for
 * devices that control actuators/sensors and communicate using
 * standard technologies. It enables adding smartness even on the
 * smallest edge devices.
 *
 * Portable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS,
 * enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different
 * targets.

/**
 * @page patterns Design Patterns
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * This page will explain the common design patterns employed by Soletta.
 *
 * @section streams IO Streams
 *
 * Soletta has its own pattern for dealing with input/output streams. This
 * section will describe how the soletta pattern is implemented and how to use it.
 *
 * The aim of this section is to guide the developer to provide a unified API for all kind of streams, making
 * it easier for a third party developer to migrate its application to any stream related IO, if necessary.
 *
 * The pattern is divided in three categories: The stream configuration, the write API and the read API.
 *
 * @subsection config Configuration
 *
 * The stream should be configured using a struct during its creation, this struct should provide the following fields.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> @c feed_size: The write buffer size - If @c 0 means that there is no limit (Data for this buffer is not necessary allocated).
 * <li> @c data_buffer_size: The read buffer size. This buffer is always allocated and the @c on_data may be called with at most @c data_buffer_size bytes - If @c 0 means that there is not limit.
 * <li> @c on_feed_done: The write callback - It will be called when data was fully written.
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> Respecting the interface:
 *    @code{.c}
 *    void (*on_feed_done)(void *user_data, my_stream_api_handle *handle, struct sol_blob *blob, int status);
 *    @endcode
 *    </ul>
 * <li> @c on_data: The read callback - It will be called when there's data available to read.
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> Respecting the interface:
 *    @code{.c}
 *    ssize_t (*on_data)(void *user_data, my_stream_api_handle *handle, const struct sol_buffer *buf);
 *    @endcode
 *    </ul>
 * <li> @c user_data: Data to @c on_data and @c on_feed_done.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Below there's a example of a configuration struct.
 * @snippet design_patterns/stream_sample.c stream config
 *
 * @subsection write Writing
 *
 * Write operations must be async and the data that will be transfered must be
 * provided as a pointer to @ref sol_blob. One should follow the API below:
 * @snippet design_patterns/stream_sample.c stream write api
 *
 * Every blob requested to be written, must be queued in order to be sent. If there's no more space
 * to queue more blobs (sum of all queued blobs >= @c feed_size) the function write should return @c -ENOSPC.
 *
 * Everytime a blob is fully written the @c on_feed_done must be called in order to inform the user that
 * the write operation was completed. The @c on_feed_done should have the following signature:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * void (*on_feed_done)(void *user_data, my_stream_api_handle *handle, struct sol_blob *blob, int status);
 * @endcode
 *
 * One should warn the user that it's not necessary to use @ref sol_blob_unref(), because the stream
 * API will already do that. The @c status variable should be 0 on success and @c -errno on error.
 * The user should be able to cancel the stream operation from the @c on_feed_done.
 *
 * Below there's an example of a stream device write implementation.
 *
 * @snippet design_patterns/stream_sample.c stream handle
 * @snippet design_patterns/stream_sample.c stream write
 *
 * @subsection read Reading
 *
 * Since this is a stream, there's no direct way for a third party developer to request a read operation.
 * In order to be able to read from the stream, the third party developer must provide the @c on_data duration the
 * stream configuration/creation. The @c on_data is provided during the stream creation, one must inform the user every time
 * data is avaible to read.
 * The @c on_data has the following signature:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * ssize_t (*on_data)(void *user_data, my_stream_api_handle *handle, const struct sol_buffer *buf);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that the @c on_data returns a @c ssize_t, the returned value must be @c -errno if an error happened or the number
 * of bytes consumed from @c buf (0 is valid). The consumed bytes will be removed from the @c buf.
 * It's important to note that the @c buf should not be modified and any references to its data should not be kept
 * after @c on_data returns.
 * Also just like @c on_feed_done, the user should be able to close/delete the stream handle inside @c on_data. Extra care
 * must be taken in order to do not crash.
 *
 * Below there's an example of the stream device read implementation.
 *
 * @snippet design_patterns/stream_sample.c stream read
 *
 * @subsection usage Usage Example
 *
 * In the following example, it will be demonstrated how one can correctly use a stream API.
 * The example is consists in an UART producer producing more data than an UART consumer can read.
 * By doing so, it will be demonstrated how flow control can be employed.
 *
 * First we start configuring the streams and creating the streams.
 * @snippet common/uart.c uart configure
 *
 * The producer will create its data every 10 ms ticks and try to send it.
 * Since the producer buffer is limited sol_uart_feed() will start to return -ENOSPC,
 * because the sum of all blobs are limited to @c feed_size.
 *
 * Below we can see how the data is produced and sent.
 * @snippet common/uart.c uart write
 *
 * It's important to note that every time sol_uart_feed() returns @c -ENOSPC the
 * data production is ceased and the blob that could not be sent is stored at the
 * @c pending_blob variable.
 *
 * Every time a blob is completely written, the @c on_feed_done is called, in this case
 * @c producer_data_written function. In this function the @c pending_blob variable
 * is checked to see if it's not @c NULL. In case it's not NULL, we try to send it.
 *
 * @snippet common/uart.c uart write completed
 *
 * By stopping the data production when sol_uart_feed() returns @c -ENOSPC we control
 * the data input flow. After sol_uart_feed() starts to accept blobs, the data
 * production can start once again.
 *
 * Now it's time to take a look at our consumer. It's a very naive consumer, it will
 * just print the data to @c stdout every time the nul byte is found.
 * In addiction it will close the UART input if it receives the "close" string.
 * Note that is completely safe to close the UART from the @c on_data (the same applies to @c on_feed_done!)
 *
 * @snippet common/uart.c uart read
 *
 * Now that you have the stream usage basics, you can start coding your apps!
 *
 * @subsection implementations Implementations
 *
 * Soletta currently implements streams for the following modules:
 * <ul>
 * <li> @ref UART
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> sol_uart_feed()
 *    <li> struct sol_uart_config
 *    </ul>
 * <li> @ref Crypto
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> sol_message_digest_feed()
 *    <li> struct sol_message_digest_config
 *    </ul>
 * <li> @ref HTTP
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> sol_http_progressive_response_feed()
 *    <li> sol_http_progressive_response_sse_feed()
 *    <li> struct sol_http_server_progressive_config
 *    <li> struct sol_http_request_interface
 *    </ul>
 * </ul>

 *
 * Some libraries will have their own internal main loop, in the case
 * we should integrate them with Soletta's we do so by adding a new
 * source of events to Soletta's main loop.
 *
 * The source is described by its @a type, a set of functions to be
 * called back at various phases:
 *
 * @li @b prepare called before all other callbacks at each main loop
 *     iteration.
 *
 * @li @b get_next_timeout called before configuring the maximum
 *     timeout to wait for events. The smallest value of all sources
 *     and the first timeout of Soletta's will be used to determine
 *     the value to use (ie: the one to give to poll(2) if using posix
 *     main loop). If returns @c false the main loop can sleep
 *     forever. If not provided, then return @c false is assumed.
 *
 * @li @b check called after all event sources and Soletta's internal
 *     events are polled and are ready to be dispatched. If it returns
 *     @c true, then there are events to be dispatched in this
 *     source.
 *
 * @li @b dispatch called if @c check() returns @c true.
 *
 * @li @c dispose called when the source is deleted. This will
 *     happen at sol_shutdown() if the source is not manually deleted.
 *
 * If a source doesn't know the time for the next event (say an
 * interruption service handler or an internal file descriptor), then
 * further integration work needs to be done. The interruption service
 * handler can use sol_timeout_add() from a thread to schedule a main
 * loop wake, that in turn will run the source's prepare()
 * automatically. Analogously, the internal file descriptors can be
 * added to soletta's at prepare(). If the main loop uses epoll(),
 * that fd can be added to chain the monitoring.
 *
 * @param type the description of the source of main loop events. This
 *        pointer is not modified and is @b not copied, thus it @b
 *        must exist during the lifetime of the source
 * @param data the user data (context) to give to callbacks in @a type
