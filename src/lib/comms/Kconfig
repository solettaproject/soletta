config COAP

	help
            The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a
            specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained
            nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.
            The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small
            amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as
            IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
            (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a
            typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is
            designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such
            as smart energy and building automation.

            CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
            application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of
            services and resources, and includes key concepts of the
            Web such as URIs and Internet media types.  CoAP is
            designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration
            with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such
            as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity
            for constrained environments.

            It is used by Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC -

    help
            MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things"
            connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely
            lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful
            for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint
            is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example,
            it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via
            satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with
            healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small
            device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because
            of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and
            efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers.

            The Soletta implementation of MQTT depends on the mosquitto library
