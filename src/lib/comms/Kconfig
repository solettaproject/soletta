            Comms consists on a few communication modules.
            It provides ways to deal with network, CoAP protocol and
            OIC protocol (server and client sides).

            The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a
            specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained
            nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.
            The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small
            amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as
            IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
            (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a
            typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is
            designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such
            as smart energy and building automation.

            CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
            application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of
            services and resources, and includes key concepts of the
            Web such as URIs and Internet media types.  CoAP is
            designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration
            with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such
            as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity
            for constrained environments.

            It is used by Open Inter Connect (OIC -
            http://openinterconnect.org/)
