 * @brief API to handle Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) protocol.
 *
 * The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a
 * specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained
 * nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.
 * The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small
 * amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as
 * IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
 * (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a
 * typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is
 * designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such
 * as smart energy and building automation.
 *
 * CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between
 * application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of
 * services and resources, and includes key concepts of the
 * Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is
 * designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration
 * with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such
 * as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity
 * for constrained environments.
 *
 * Relevant RFCs:
 * - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252: The Constrained Application
 *   Protocol (CoAP)
 * - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7641: Observing Resources in the
 *   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
