 *
 * MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity
 * protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight
 * publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections
 * with remote locations where a small code footprint is required
 * and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been
 * used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over
 * occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a
 * range of home automation and small device scenarios. It is also ideal
 * for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage,
 * minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to
 * one or many receivers
