/**
 * @defgroup StaticFlow Static Flow
 * @ingroup Flow
 *
 * @brief Static flow is a parent node that creates its children nodes and
 * routes packets between them.
 *
 * It follows an specification received upon creation. The @c configuration
 * of the flow (connections made) will not change at runtime -- thus the name static.
 *
 * The specification consists in two arrays: one indicating each node
 * type, and the other indicating each connection as a sequence of
 * (source node, source port, destination node, destination port)
 * tuples.
 *
 * The connection specification is used to dispatch connections when
 * messages are sent. This approach provides a very low memory
 * overhead but still perfomant way to route the packets.
