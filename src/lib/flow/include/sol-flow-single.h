 *
 * Sometimes it is desired to use a single node, manually feeding
 * packets and processing those being sent on the node's output port.
 *
 * The single node type does exactly that by wrapping a base type
 * (also called "child type"), it will create an internal node and
 * take care to deliver incoming packets to that and also take its
 * outgoing packets and calling the provided @c process() method, if
 * any.
 *
 * It also forwards connections and disconnections requests, as some
 * nodes will only work if there is a connection established for a
 * given port.
