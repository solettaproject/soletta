The tests are regular FBP files with comments that describe what is
expected from them. While they can be executed using regular
sol-fbp-runner, it's more convenient to use 'tools/run-fbp-tests',
from the source root directory.

    # Run all the tests inside src/test-fbp.
    $ tools/run-fbp-tests

    # Run only specific set of tests, accepts directories too.
    $ tools/run-fbp-tests src/test-fbp/declare.fbp src/test-fbp/parser-errors/

For convenience, 'make check-fbp' and 'make check-fbp-valgrind' will
call the script with appropriate arguments to run all the tests in
'src/test-fbp/'.

By default a test is considered to pass if it exits with code equals
to 0. Test meta-data can be passed by using comments that start with a
double hash. If an error is expected, this can be specified by adding
the comment

    ## TEST-EXPECTS-ERROR

to the test. An expected output can be provided by using

    ## TEST-OUTPUT
    # Output line 1.
    # Output line 2.
    # Last output line.

    # Comments after the first blank line will be ignored.

Tests can also be skipped by adding a comment

    ## TEST-SKIP Skipped because reason XYZ.

The reason provided will be part of the execution output but won't
count as a failure.

It also supports regular expressions variants. Its syntax
is described at https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html.
In order to use regex, just use TEST-OUTPUT-REGEX instead
of TEST-OUTPUT. So it will look for an expression match.

If output messages from SOL_WRN and friends are expected using
regular expressions is required, since they contain implementation
information (line, column, file name in the source) that might
change as the code evolves.

In all cases it's important that your flow ends at some point, look at
the 'test' or 'app' modules to ways to do it. Usually TEST_RESULT is
good enough.
