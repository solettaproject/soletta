            This service will enumerate all network interfaces using
            netlink and then bring up all of them.

            If the kernel is configured for IPv6 (CONFIG_IPV6=y) then
            an automatic address is assigned based on the MAC address.

            This service relies on netlink communication with the
            kernel.
