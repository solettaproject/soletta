		ThingSpeak is a service that allows publishing data via HTTP
		to be consumed by IoT devices.

		It is an open platform, with full source code available.
		There is also a free service with API call rate limits.  If
		the rate limits are too low for your application, you can
		set up a server yourself; the node types allow specifying
		the API endpoint.

		This option enables three node types:

                  * thingspeak/talkback-execute, to query ThingSpeak's
                      Talkback queue
                  * thingspeak/talkback-add, to add something to the Talkback
                      queue
                  * thingspeak/channel-update, to update a channel

		To use these nodes, one must register and obtain an API key.
		API keys for channels and talkbacks are different.  For the
		talkback, obtaining a Talkback ID is also required.

		If unsure, say Y.
