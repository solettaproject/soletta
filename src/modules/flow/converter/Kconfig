		The converter family of nodes will convert Soletta
		packets from one type to another (e.g. boolean to
		byte). Some of them will do more fancy things, like
		splitting a byte into (boolean) individual bits.
		Others will compose a final packet from others, like
		assembling four bytes into a final integer. You'll
		also find a node that splits an error packet in other
		twoâ€”its integer code and its string message. There are
		also the nodes dealing with JSON data (e.g. one that
		gets a string packet and outputs a JSON array packet,
		if the string is valid). Finally, there are some nodes
		converting some packet types to string packets,
		namely float-to-string and int-to-string. These last
		two have sibling nodes doing a more elaborate string
		formatting output, but they belong in another flow
		module: py-formatting.
