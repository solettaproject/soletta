		It is common to have IoT products with LCD display and
		buttons (arrows) and the need to ask for user input.
		This is a collection of high-level node types to deal
		with that, the *form* nodes.

		These node types format a multi-line string to be
		used by other node types doing visual output, such as
		LCD display (jhd1313m1), in conjuntion with others
		providing input.
