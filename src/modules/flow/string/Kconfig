		The string family of nodes provide string facilities
		on your flow, acting on the strings contained in
		string packets:

		 - generate UUID strings
		 - split a string in others
		 - compare/concatenate two strings
		 - replace a substring in a string
		 - measure the lenght of the string
		 - change a string to lower/uppercase
		 - check whether a string stards/ends with another
		 - replace regular expression patterns in a string
		 - search for regular expression patterns in a string

		For the nodes dealing with regular expressions, only
		one RE backend is supported: libpcre. If that
		dependency is not present, those nodes will be built
		but made useless -- they will always generate error
		packets after any input ones.

		For each of the remaining string nodes, there may be
		two implementations (depending on the presence of the
		ICU library or not). We strongly recommend that you
		build Soletta with ICU, so that the full UTF-8 set of
		characters is properly handled by the string nodes.

# This is the solely user of ICU. If gets wider use, move up in the
# hierarchy.

# This is the solely user of LIBPCRE. If gets wider use, move up in
# the hierarchy.
config USE_LIBPCRE
	bool "Use LIBPCRE library"
