/**
 * @brief Wraps a function call to an external callback
 *
 * @param handle The reentrant tracking the structure affected by the
 * function call
 *
 * Wraps the statement or statement block following it by marking the handle
 * passed in as the parameter as being in use. Thus, if you call an external
 * callback from within the block which attempts to free the structure, the
 * structure will be protected from deletion by the flags set in the preamble.
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 * SO_REENTRANT_CALL(context->reentrant) {
 *     context->cb(context->data);
 *     context->cb_was_called = true;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * will ensure that the context will not be freed as part of the call to
 * <code>context->cb()</code> and will be available after
 * <code>context->cb()</code> returns as long as all calls to free the context
 * are made via SOL_REENTRANT_FREE().
