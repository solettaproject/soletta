# Read temperature and humidity from an AM2315 device and prints them.
# It's interesting to notice that this device needs at least two seconds
# between two readings. As 'timer' ticks once each second, some readings
# should return cached data - nodes behaviour when someone tries to read
# before the two seconds interval.
