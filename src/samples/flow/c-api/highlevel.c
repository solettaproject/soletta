/**
 * @file highlevel.c
 *
 * Example of soletta's flow in C using high-level API. It will
 * manipulate the nodes and connections using easy to use and human
 * readable strings.
 *
 * There is a runtime penalty as this requires node type descriptions
 * to be available, consuming disk and memory space, thus it is not
 * recommended for very constrained systems.
 *
 * See lowlevel.c on how to use the lowlevel API that does not rely on
 * node type descriptions.
