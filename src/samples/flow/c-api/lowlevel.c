/**
 * @file lowlevel.c
 *
 * Example of soletta's flow in C using low-level API. It will
 * manipulate the nodes and connections by indexes in space-efficient
 * lookup matrices.
 *
 * It's not as nice to use, matrices are looked up in place and thus
 * must be in correct ascending order.
 *
 * This is the most efficient way to use soletta, but it's not user
 * friendly. To solve this we recommend one to write FBP files and use
 * da-fbp-generator to create the efficient lowlevel flow of it.
 *
 * See highlevel.c on how to use the lowlevel API that does not rely on
 * node type descriptions.
