# This file will output Soletta's semaphore monitor status.
#
# It will check the build status every 5 seconds by using another FBP
# that provides the logic to get semaphore build status.
#
# It is an example of:
#
#  - timer node type (timeout mainloop primitive)
#
#  - using 'DECLARE' statements to include other FBP as a node type
#
#  - console node type
#
