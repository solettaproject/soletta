# This file will output Soletta's semaphore monitor status.
#
# It will check the build status by getting the semaphore SVG and
# applying a regular expression to see if it failed or passed.
#
# It is only the base component, one still need to call its exported
# input port UPDATE to trigger the action and wait for output packets
# on the STATUS port. See semaphore-monitor-console.fbp for an example
# that uses this.
#
# It is an example of:
#
#  - http-client/string node type (get the SVG as plain text)
#
#  - string/regexp-search node type (extract passed/failed string)
