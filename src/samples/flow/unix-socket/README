These examples cover the unix-socket node types.

They are useful to provide fast inter-process-communication and they
work by specifying a path to the unix socket to use and the mode
(server or client). Then the server will accept connection from
different local processes and read the data (if a reader) or broadcast
it (if a writer). Servers should always be started before clients, as
they will create the socket to accept connections.  By default writer
nodes are server, unless defined as a node option.

As both processes are local, no endianess conversion is done and the
packets are considered to be of exact sizes, otherwise the peer may
close the connection if it could not read or write the required
amount.

One can implement isolation and security using this communication
primitive and some external mechanism. For instance one can isolate
node memory by moving them to different UNIX processes. There are
platform-dependent security systems such as SELinux or SECCOMP to
filter syscalls a process may do or resources it may access. One
example is provided using systemd and syscall filtering in ../systemd.
