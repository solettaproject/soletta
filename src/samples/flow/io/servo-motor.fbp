# This example controls a servo and sets its angle, adjusting every 3
# seconds. The node type is resolved using the
# sol-flow-intel-edison-rev-c.json. If running in a different board,
# please adjust to your needs and:
#
#    $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=<your-config>.json
#    $ ./servo-motor.fbp
#
# or save it as sol-flow.json
