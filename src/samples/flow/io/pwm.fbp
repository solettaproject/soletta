# This example enables a PWM called 'led1' and sets the duty cycle of
# another called 'led2'. These node types are resolved using the
# pwm.json (edited for leds on pins 3 and 5 on Edison board),
# please adjust to your board configuration:
#
#    $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=pwm-myboard.json
#    $ ./pwm.fbp
#
# or save it as sol-flow.json

t2 OUT -> INC acc OUT -> DUTY_CYCLE led2(Led2)
