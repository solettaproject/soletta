# This example enables a PWM called 'led1' and sets the duty cycle of
# another called 'led2'. These node types are resolved using the
# sol-flow-intel-edison-rev-c.json. If running in a different board,
# please adjust to your needs and:
#
#    $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=<your-config>.json
#    $ ./pwm.fbp
#
# or save it as sol-flow.json

t1(timer:interval=1000)
t2(timer:interval=250)
toggle(boolean/toggle)
acc(int/accumulator:setup_value=min:0|max:2032605|step:7971)

t1 OUT -> IN toggle OUT -> ENABLED led1(Led1)
toggle OUT -> IN c1(console:prefix="Led1 ")
t2 OUT -> INC acc OUT -> DUTY_CYCLE led2(Led2)
