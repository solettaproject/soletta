These examples show how to access input/output (I/O) ports on your boards.

Since board configuration changes a lot and there is no way to
autodetect it, you need to create a configuration file (json-based) and
specify it using the environment variable: $SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE

For instance, say you copied pwm.json to pwm-myboard.json and edited
it to fit your needs, then run:

   $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=pwm-myboard.json
   $ ./pwm.fbp

Same for other files with associated ".json". If you fail to do so,
you may receive an error such as:

   $ ./pwm.fbp
   ./pwm.fbp:41:36 Couldn't resolve type name 'Led1'

This is because there is no group in one named Led1
configuration file supported by the system, you can define one using
the environment variable.

Alternatively you can define all your entries in a file called
'sol-flow.json' and it will be looked up in the current folder, then
no environment variable is needed.

Some boards have specific node types, they have their own examples in
a sibling directory such as minnow-calamari or grove-kit.
