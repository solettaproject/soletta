/**
 * @file arctan-node.c
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of custom node types. It uses
 * generated boilerplate from JSON which later modified to
 * perform arctangent algorithm.
 *
 * The instruction used to generate custom node template code from
 * arctan-spec.json which eventually being included into arctan-node.c:
 *
 *    $ sol-flow-node-type-gen.py \
 *            --prefix sol_flow_node_type --genspec-schema \
 *            /usr/share/soletta/flow/schemas/node-type-genspec.schema \
 *            arctan-spec.json \
 *            arctan-spec-gen.h \
 *            arctan-spec-gen.c \
 *            arctan-spec-gen.json
 *
 * The instruction to compile this custom node:
 *    $ gcc `pkg-config --libs --cflags soletta` \
 *          -DSOL_FLOW_NODE_TYPE_MODULE_EXTERNAL=1 \
 *          -shared -fPIC arctan-node.c -o arctangent.so
 *
 * The location to install arctangent.so:
 *    $ install -m 0755 arctangent.so /usr/lib/soletta/modules/flow/

/**
 * Logic:
 *
 * This node will receive a float input and then calculate the
 * value of arctangent of it to be feed at the output port.
 * Formula for arctangent power series and reciprocal arguments
 * are as follows:
 *
 *     arctangent(x) = summation[(-1)^n * (z^(2n+1) / 2n+1)]
 *
 *     arctangent(x) = -(PI/2) - arctangent(1/x)
 *
 * Detailed explanation can be refered at :
 *
 *     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions
 *
 * This node contains no data, it will recompute everything based on
 * the last received packet, thus there is no node private data, open
 * or close methods.
