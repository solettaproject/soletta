# This is one of the translations of Grove_LED/Grove_LED.ino, from
# https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook_Starter_Kit_for_Arduino.git
# Here we exemplify the usage of the wave generator node type in order
# to do the original file's looping. There's another example doing
# that by means of the accumulator node -- check
# grove-led-accumulator.fbp

# We split the duty_cycle of 2040816 ns (490 Hz for full intensity),
# into 256 slices of 7971, mimicking analogWrite()'s range: 0 to 255
