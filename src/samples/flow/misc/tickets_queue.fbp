# This is an example that simulates two ticket machines:
# one for regular and other for preferencial tickets.
# And a cashier, that when press the button call the next
# ticket, preferencials first. It won't call anybody
# if such queues are empty already.
#
# To test it, press 'p' to emit a preferencial ticket,
# 'n' for regular ticket and 'c' to call the next ticket.
