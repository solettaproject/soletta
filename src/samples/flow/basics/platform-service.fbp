# This example timely (every second) query the state of 'bluetooth'
# service. This is not required as every platform should monitor the
# status of its native service and report updates on ACTIVE port
# anyway. But with the timer ticking on the TRIGGER port we force it.
#
# It is an example of:
#
#  - timer node type (timeout mainloop primitive)
#
#  - platform service node type
