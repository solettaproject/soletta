This directory contains examples covering the basics of Soletta flows.

The scripts should be executable given that sol-fbp-runner is in your
$PATH, otherwise call manually sol-fbp-runner <script>

Each file include the description of what it does and what is exemplified.

Note that soletta applications are usually meant to run forever as
they are "the device application", so most of them will never exit and
you need to manually terminate them sending an UNIX signal such as
SIGTERM or SIGINT (such as key sequence Control-C).

The simple.fbp is converted to low-level C-API using sol-fbp-generator
to simple-fbp.c, it is an example that the script can be turned into
native code for efficiency matters. See ../c-api for more examples
doing directly in C.
