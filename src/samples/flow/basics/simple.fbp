# This file is a simple flow that has a 1000ms (1 second) timer as
# source of events, each tick it will toggle a boolean value that goes
# to console_toggle (the result of the toggle) and also to a boolean
# inverter (not), that also goes to console via console_not.
#
# It is an example of:
#
#  - timer node type (timeout mainloop primitive)
#
#  - boolean node types (toggle and not)
#
#  - console node type (by default prefixes messages with node names)
