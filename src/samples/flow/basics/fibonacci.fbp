# This file shows a Fibonacci implementation, not much useful per se, but
# is an example of:
#
#  - declaring nodes without a connection
#
#  - integer node types (constant/int and int/addition)
#
#  - toggle node type (boolean/toggle)
#
#  - switcher node types (switcher/int)
#
#  - console node type (using a custom prefix)
#
#  - anonymous nodes (the '_' character)
#
#  - quit the application (app/quit)
#
#  - closed loops: the output of first addition (sum1) is feed to the
#    second (sum2) that is then feedback to sum1. In many flow
#    platforms this would crash due infinite recursion, but the way
#    soletta is implemented allow this without problems as each
#    iteration happens in its own mainloop execution.
#
#  - multiple connections per port: both the constant 'one' and the
#    result of 'sum2' are connected to the second port (IN1) of
#    'sum1'. There is no problem, as the constant will only produce
#    the value on connection, while the addition produces new values
#    when any of its input ports change. The most recent value is used
#    by the port, then 'sum1' keeps being updated on every change (the
#    recursion).
#
#  - error handling: all nodes have an implicit port 'ERROR' that is
#    used to dispatch any error that may happen with the node. The
#    addition node will report overflows there and it's used to stop
#    the program.

### declare nodes we'll use later:
# constants:
one(constant/int:value=1)
zero(constant/int:value=0)
# operations
sum(int/addition)
switcher(switcher/int)
toggle(boolean/toggle)
# output
fib(console:prefix="fibonacci=")

### implement the fibonacci recursive algorithm
# base: 0 + 1 -> sum
zero OUT -> OPERAND[0] sum
one OUT -> OPERAND[1] sum

# next number in fibonacci is sum of last two sums, so
# alternating the input port of addition node will assure this.
# a toggle can change the port index of a switcher at each sum
switcher OUT[0] -> OPERAND[0] sum
switcher OUT[1] -> OPERAND[1] sum
toggle OUT -> IN _(converter/boolean-to-int) OUT -> OUT_PORT switcher
sum OUT -> IN toggle

# base: sum + last var (switcher does the trick)
sum OUT -> IN[0] switcher

### output the results
# first output the '1' only once (since it's a constant)
one OUT -> IN fib
# then output each result of sum
sum OUT -> IN fib

### stop when it reaches variable limit (integer overflow)
sum ERROR -> QUIT _(app/quit)
