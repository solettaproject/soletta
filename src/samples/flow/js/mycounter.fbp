# This sample shows that JS node types can be used multiple times to
# create nodes.
#
# c1 and c2 are different nodes, but from the same JS type, MyCounter.
#
# MyCounter receives a boolean value and adds or subtracts from the
# initial counter value (0) depending on this boolean value.
#
# +1 for TRUE and -1 for FALSE
