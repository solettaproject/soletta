# This is a sample where you have the attendee (that will call the next in line)
# and two different lines, common and preferential (that has higher priority).
#
# Everytime the a line button is pressed (common or preferential) it generates
# a new number to be called, preferential numbers are 1-99 and common are 101-999.
#
# In order to do so we created our custom JS node type, MyAttendee from attendee.js
# file.
