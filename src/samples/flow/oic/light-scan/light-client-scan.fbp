# This will wait for 3 seconds, then scan for OIC lights.
# The oic node type and IO node types are resolved by
# sol-flow.json, using gtk backend, or sol-flow-intel-edison-rev-c.json.
#
# To run this sample in an edison device connect an LCD to I2C port,
# 3 buttons in ports IO3, IO4 and IO7 and a
# LED to IO8.
#
# Then run:
#
#    $ ./light-client-scan.fbp

#Input/Output nodes

next(BtnNext)
select(BtnSelect)
light_button(BtnLight)

#Scanning
light(oic/client-brightlight)
