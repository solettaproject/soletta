Grove Starter Kit Plus - Intel IoT Edition for Intel Galileo Gen 2
Developer Kit is a complete hardware & software solution to help you
explore the IoT space and create innovative projects. It is a starter
kit for Intel Galileo Gen2 providing a collection of sensors,
actuators and shields.

Most of the samples are translations of Arduino Sketches, these are
listed inside each script.

Since the components may be assembled on different hardware I/O, one
need to declare its configuration file with the correct pins to use.
For instance, say your board already has a configuration file or you have
written your own, then run:

   $ ./grove-button.fbp

Same for other files with associated ".json". If you fail to do so,
you may receive an error such as:

   $ ./grove-button.fbp
   ./grove-button.fbp:37:1 Couldn't resolve type name 'Button'

This is because there is no Button group in one
configuration file supported by the system, you can define one using
the environment variable.

Alternatively you can define all your entries in a file called
'sol-flow.json' and it will be looked up in the current folder.
