# This is a subflow to be used in fossball.fbp
#
# It exports two input ports (RESET and WIN_SCORE) and one output port
# (WON).

INPORT=score.RESET:RESET
INPORT=won.IN[1]:WIN_SCORE
OUTPORT=won.OUT:WON

goal(gtk/pushbutton) OUT -> PULSE_IF_TRUE toggle(converter/boolean-to-empty) OUT -> INC score(int/accumulator) OUT -> IN output(gtk/label)

score OUT -> IN[0] won(int/greater-or-equal)
