# Brief:

# This sensor will export oic/server-light resource and also listen
# for HTTP requests on port 8002 using the http-light-server.
#
# values are persisted to filesystem storage and applied to
# StateActuator and PowerActuator defined at sol-flow*.json

# here, rather will all serve requests from the same event (main)
# loop, the one that is also used to receive hardware events and
