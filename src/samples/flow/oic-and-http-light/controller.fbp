# Brief:
#
# Controller logic.
#
# This FBP handles input, stores the current value, emits value
# changes on its output ports and take new values on input ports.
#
# It receives input from buttons defined in sol-flow*.json
# (per-board), will load values from server at start and post to
# server on changes.
