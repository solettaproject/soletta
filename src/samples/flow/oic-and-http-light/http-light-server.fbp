# Brief:

# This file wraps low-level primitive http-server nodes into
# a high-level "http-light-server" that can be used as a single entity

# Each node will register a path in a singleton server that is
# maintained by Soletta for each port.
#
# This means one can have as many node of type http-server as desired,
# and they can exist in the same or different ports.
#
# The server is built-in to Soletta and executes in-process, thus
# whenever the application quits, the server stops.
