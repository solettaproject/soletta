# Example of an EFI startup script to be used with linux-micro-efi-update
# module. It checks existence of 'updating' file to determine that
# an update happened and creates a 'check-update' file that new version
# should delete when first started. If it fails for some reason, this script
# will start kernel using a backup as init program.
