# This sample creates two MQTT clients:
#  * a publisher that send the message "Hello World" at every second
#    on topic "soletta/mqtt/test"
#  * a subscriber that print all messages published on topic
#    "soletta/mqtt/test" to console
#
# NOTE: This sample expects that a MQTT broker is running on
# the local machine on the default port (1883)
# It may be done by simply running mosquitto (http://mosquitto.org) local
# (with default configuration) or other broker of preference.

# subscribe
sub(mqtt/client:host="127.0.0.1",topic="soletta/mqtt/test")
# publish
pub(mqtt/client:host="127.0.0.1",topic="soletta/mqtt/test")

# Message
hello_world(constant/string:value="Hello World")

# output
pub_out(console:prefix="pub=")
sub_out(console:prefix="sub=")

# Use "Hello World" as the message payload
hello_world OUT -> IN _(converter/string-to-blob) OUT -> DATA pub

# Subscribe to topic on start
_(constant/empty) OUT -> SUBSCRIBE sub

# Publish a message every 1 second
timer(timer:interval=1000) OUT -> PUBLISH pub

# print to console received message
sub OUTDATA -> IN _(converter/blob-to-string) OUT -> IN sub_out

# print error to console
pub ERROR -> IN _(converter/error) MESSAGE -> IN pub_out
sub ERROR -> IN _(converter/error) MESSAGE -> IN sub_out
