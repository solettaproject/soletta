sol-fbp-runner will read the options from sol-flow.conf.

### Special note if your Linux Kernel version is >=  3.18.

The following samples make use of GPIOs and require special attention:
 * calamari-7seg.fbp
 * calamari-buttons-rgb-led.fbp
 * calamari-rgb-led.fbp
 * calamari-lever.fbp

### Why?
The GPIO pins numbers have changed in Linux Kernel 3.18,
the original pin numbers were added by 256.

sol-flow.conf contains the original numbers, prior to Linux Kernel 3.18.

sol-flow-new.conf contains the same content, but with the GPIO pin numbers
added by 256. So, if your Linux Kernel >= 3.18, please,
use this file.

Basically, there are two methods of doing that:

 * Method 1 [recommended] - Run:
        SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=sol-flow-new.conf sol-fbp-runner example.fbp

 * Method 2 - Update the sol-flow.conf file manually. You can edit it manually or copy the
contents from sol-flow.conf:
        cp sol-flow-new.conf sol-flow.conf
        sol-fbp-runner example.fbp
