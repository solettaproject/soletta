This showcases the Intel MinnoBoard Max using the Calamari Lure.

sol-fbp-runner will read the options from sol-flow.json.

### Special note if your Linux Kernel version is >=  3.18.

The following samples make use of GPIOs and require special attention:
 * calamari-7seg-segments.fbp
 * calamari-7seg-value.fbp
 * calamari-buttons-rgb-led.fbp
 * calamari-rgb-led.fbp
 * calamari-lever.fbp

### Why?

The GPIO pins numbers have changed in Linux Kernel 3.18,
the original pin numbers were added by 256.

sol-flow.json contains the original numbers, prior to Linux Kernel 3.18.

sol-flow-intel-minnow-max-linux_gt_3_19.json contains the same content,
but with the GPIO pin numbers added by 256.  So, if your Linux Kernel >= 3.18,
please, use this file.

If for any given reason the correct config files is not being autodetect,
there are two methods of enforce the use of a specific config file:

 * Method 1 [recommended] - Run:
        SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=sol-flow-intel-minnow-max-linux_gt_3_19.json sol-fbp-runner example.fbp

 * Method 2 - Update the sol-flow.json file manually. You can edit it manually or copy the
contents from sol-flow.json:
        cp sol-flow-intel-minnow-max-linux_gt_3_19.json sol-flow.json
        sol-fbp-runner example.fbp
