# This example will blink each of the Red, Green and Blue LEDs in the
# calamari/rgb-led. It does so by incrementing the accumulator every
# second, then converting the accumulator integer value to bits, the
# first bit goes to Red, the second to Green and the third to Blue.

accumulator(int/accumulator:setup_value=min:0|max:255|step:1)

timer(wallclock/second) OUT -> INC accumulator
accumulator OUT -> IN int_to_byte(converter/int-to-byte)
int_to_byte OUT -> IN byte_to_bits(converter/byte-to-bits)
byte_to_bits OUT[0] -> RED led(RGBLed)
byte_to_bits OUT[1] -> GREEN led
byte_to_bits OUT[2] -> BLUE led
