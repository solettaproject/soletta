To properly versioning the Soletta (TM) Project the
following variables are used and should be updated
before each new release (all of them on Makefiles.vars)

The shared object versioning follows libtool approach.

    * SOL_VERSION -> project version, not related to soname
    * SOL_CURRENT
    * SOL_AGE
    * SOL_REVISION

1) At every release you should increment SOL_VERSION
2) If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then increment SOL_REVISION
3) If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update, increment SOL_CURRENT, and set SOL_REVISION to 0.
4) If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then increment SOL_AGE.
5) If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public release, then set SOL_AGE to 0.
