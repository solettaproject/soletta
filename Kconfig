	help
            This option enables dynamically loadable modules to be
            created and used by Soletta. These modules can be created
            and installed post libsoletta creation and when removed
            shouldn't impact those that do not use such
            functionality.

            Modules are usually distributed as ".so" (shared objects)
            and are usually loaded by libc (libdl) function
            dlopen(). The modules are commonly installed at
            $PREFIX/lib/soletta/modules/<subsystem>/<module>.

            One would disable the modules support only when doing
            single-binary static builds, in this case all modules
            would be known at compile time, thus the code path can be
            avoided and the dependency on extra libraries (ie: -ldl
            on Linux) is not needed.

            If unsure, say Y.

config PREFIX
	string "Installation prefix"
	default "/usr"
	help
            This path is the intended installation prefix for the
            binaries. It is used by code paths that need to look for
            further resources, such as loadable module support (see
            MODULES configuration help).
